            CSS
        </h3>
        <p>I Have learnt to do CSS, the different styling properties.. The different attributes to my styles. I have learnt how to make my 
            website look nicer with colours, fonts and spaces. I have learnt to better organise the contents on my website as well. 
            I remember when I first did my week 1 coding website (Cake Recipe), the contents were all messy and it was hard to format
            the website in a neat manner. Through the different divisions of the website, I am better able to cluster them 
            into one style format for each part of the website. 
            Only through proper sorting can I ensure that my website is made in an orderly and organised manner.
